# Welcome ! 

This is a small repository where you will find some scripts and markdown files used to study the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum in the Black Sea using Biogeochemical-Argo floats.

The available files are the following:

- 2 scripts for processing raw ARGO data (DataExtractionCleaning for extracting and applying corrections to Chla data mostly, DataFit for fitting Chla data to known analytical forms). Those scripts are here to show what we did but won't work without the Merged files from the 5 floats (WMO 6900807, 6901866, 7900591, 7900592 & 6903240). Therefore, we provide DataPaper.RData which contains all results.

- 2 mardown files (article_figures from Arthur Capet and Florian Ricour) which will display all figures used in the article based on the RData file.

Enjoy !
